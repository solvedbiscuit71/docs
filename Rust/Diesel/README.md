# Diesel

Diesel is a Safe, Extensible ORM and Query Builder for **Rust**.

Add to following to your Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
diesel = { version = "1.4.8", features = ["postgres"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"
```

# Adding .env

This program requires the user to setup the enviroment variable **DATABASE_URL** in .env

Run,
```sh
echo DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/diesel_demo > .env
```

Replace,
* username -> with the username register in postgres
* password -> with the responding password
* diesel_demo -> database that exists in postgres

# Diesel CLI
Diesel CLI helps us to setup migrations, Here, we are using *postgres*
```sh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

Then, run `diesel setup`  
Which creates migrations directory with `diesel.toml` file for configuration.

# Creating new migration

Use,
```sh
diesel migration generate create_posts
```

Which in turn, creates two file `up.sql` & `down.sql`
* up.sql -> creating stuff
* down.sql -> redo the stuff being created

up.sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 'f'
);
```

down.sql
```sql
DROP TABLE posts;
```

We can apply the new migration using,
```sh
diesel migration run
```

and, to redo run,
```sh
diesel migration redo
```

**Result**: this creates a **src/schema.rs** file in src directory which will be used by our code.

# migration in production

When preparing your app for use in production, you may want to run your migrations during the applicationâ€™s initialization phase. You may also want to include the migration scripts as a part of your code, to avoid having to copy them to your deployment location/image etc.  

The [diesel_migrations](https://docs.rs/crate/diesel_migrations/latest) crate provides the **embed_migrations!** macro, allowing you to embed migration scripts in the final binary. Once your code uses it, you can simply include **embedded_migrations::run(&db_conn)** at the start of your **main** function to run migrations every time the application starts.
